# Contact Manager

Final project for CS230 at Wellesley College by Samantha Voight and Aline Mitsuzawa.

Description

This app aims to facilitate the process of networking and rekindling connections.
It is a program for contact management, in which the user can input useful information about professional contacts, such as where they work and how they met. The user can then track people they have met or made contact with and update information for future reference.

Technical Details

Contact Manager is a Java desktop application built with Swing and storage in a separate text file.
The projectâ€™s goal was to effectively use the data structures in class to produce optimal solutions in terms of space and time complexity, and increase our proficiency in Java.
